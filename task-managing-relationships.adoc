You can manage sync relationships in NetApp Copy and Sync at any time by immediately syncing data, changing schedules, and more.

== Perform an immediate data sync

Rather than wait for the next scheduled sync, you can press a button to immediately sync data between the source and target.

.Steps


. link:task-login-copyandsync.html[Log in to Copy and Sync].
. From the *Dashboard*, navigate to the sync relationship and select image:icon-sync-action.png[A screenshot of the button that enables you to take actions on a sync relationship]

. Select *Sync Now* and then select *Sync* to confirm.

//image:screenshot_dashboard_actions.gif[This screenshot shows the actions that you can perform on a sync relationship.]

.Result

Copy and Sync starts the data sync process for the relationship.

== Accelerate sync performance

Accelerate the performance of a sync relationship by adding an additional data broker to the group that manages the relationship. The additional data broker must be a _new_ data broker.

.How this works

If the data broker group manages other sync relationships, then the new data broker that you add to the group also accelerates the performance of those sync relationships.

For example, let's say you have three relationships:

* Relationship 1 is managed by data broker group A
* Relationship 2 is managed by data broker group B
* Relationship 3 is managed by data broker group A

You want to accelerate the performance of relationship 1 so you add a new data broker to data broker group A. Because group A also manages sync relationship 3, the sync performance for relationship is automatically accelerated as well.

.Steps

. Ensure that at least one of the existing data brokers in the relationship are online.

. From the *Dashboard*, navigate to the sync relationship and select image:icon-sync-action.png[A screenshot of the button that enables you to take actions on a sync relationship]

. Select *Accelerate*.
//+
//image:screenshot_accelerate.gif[A screenshot of Copy and Sync that shows the action menu for a sync relationship. Accelerate is highlighted with the mouse pointer.]

. Follow the prompts to create a new data broker.

.Result

Copy and Sync adds the new data broker to the group. The performance of the next data sync should be accelerated.

== Update credentials

You can update the data broker with the latest credentials of the source or target in an existing sync relationship. Updating the credentials can help if your security policies require you to update credentials on a periodic basis.

Updating credentials is supported with any source or target that Copy and Sync requires credentials for: Azure Blob, Box, IBM Cloud Object Storage, StorageGRID, ONTAP S3 Storage, SFTP, and SMB servers.

.Steps

. From the *Sync Dashboard*, go to a sync relationship that requires credentials and then select *Update Credentials*.
+
image:screenshot_sync_update_credentials.png[A screenshot that shows the Update Credentials option on the Sync Relationships page just under the name of the source or target.]

. Enter the credentials and select *Update*.
+
A note about SMB servers: if the domain is new, then you'll need to specify it when you update the credentials. If the domain hasn't changed, then you don't need to enter it again.
+
If you entered a domain when you created the sync relationship, but you don't enter a new domain when you update the credentials, then Copy and Sync will keep using the original domain that you provided.

.Result

Copy and Sync updates the credentials on the data broker. It can take up 10 minutes until the data broker starts using the updated credentials for data syncs.

== Set up notifications

A *Notifications* setting for each sync relationship enables you to choose whether to receive Copy and Sync notifications in the NetApp Console's Notification Center. You can enable notifications for successful data syncs, failed data syncs, and canceled data syncs.

In addition, you can also receive notifications by email.

.Steps

. Modify the settings for a sync relationship:

.. From the *Dashboard*, navigate to the sync relationship and select image:icon-sync-action.png[A screenshot of the button that enables you to take actions on a sync relationship]

.. Select *Settings*.

.. Enable *Notifications*.

.. Select *Save Settings*.

. If you want to receive notifications by email, configure alert and notifications settings:

.. Select *Settings > Alerts and Notifications Settings*.

.. Select a user or multiple users and choose the *Info* notification type.

.. Select *Apply*.

.Result

You'll now receive Copy and Sync notifications in the NetApp Console's Notification Center, with a few notifications arriving by email, if you configured that option.

== Change the settings for a sync relationship

Modify settings that define how source files and folders are synced and maintained in the target location.

. From the *Dashboard*, navigate to the sync relationship and select image:icon-sync-action.png[A screenshot of the button that enables you to take actions on a sync relationship]

. Select *Settings*.

. Modify any of the settings.

+
[[deleteonsource]] Here's a brief description of each setting:
+
Schedule:: Choose a recurring schedule for future syncs or turn off the sync schedule. You can schedule a relationship to sync data as often as every 1 minute.

Sync Timeout:: Define whether Copy and Sync should cancel a data sync if the sync hasn't completed in the specified number of minutes, hours, or days.

Notifications:: Enables you to choose whether to receive Copy and Sync notifications in the NetApp Console's Notification Center. You can enable notifications for successful data syncs, failed data syncs, and canceled data syncs.
+
If you want to receive notifications for

Retries:: Define the number of times that Copy and Sync should retry to sync a file before skipping it.

Compare By:: Choose whether Copy and Sync should compare certain attributes when determining whether a file or directory has changed and should be synced again.
+
Even if you uncheck these attributes, Copy and Sync still compares the source to the target by checking the paths, file sizes, and file names. If there are any changes, then it syncs those files and directories.
+
You can choose to enable or disable Copy and Sync from comparing the following attributes:
+
* *mtime*: The last modified time for a file. This attribute isn't valid for directories.
* *uid*, *gid*, and *mode*: Permission flags for Linux.

Copy for Objects:: You can't edit this option after you create the relationship.

Recently Modified Files:: Choose to exclude files that were recently modified prior to the scheduled sync.

Delete Files on Source::
Choose to delete files from the source location after Copy and Sync copies the files to the target location. This option includes the risk of data loss because the source files are deleted after they're copied.
+
If you enable this option, you also need to change a parameter in the local.json file on the data broker. Open the file and update it as follows:
+
[source,json]
{
"workers":{
"transferrer":{
"delete-on-source": true
}
}
}
+
After updating the local.json file, you should do a restart: `pm2 restart all`.

Delete Files on Target:: Choose to delete files from the target location, if they were deleted from the source. The default is to never deletes files from the target location.

File Types:: Define the file types to include in each sync: files, directories, symbolic links, and hard links.
+
NOTE: Hard links are only available for unsecured NFS to NFS relationships. Users will be limited to one scanner process and one scanner concurrency, and scans must be run from a root directory.

Exclude File Extensions:: Specify the regex or file extensions to exclude from the sync by typing the file extension and pressing *Enter*. For example, type _log_ or _.log_ to exclude *.log files. A separator isn't required for multiple extensions. The following video provides a short demo:
+
video::7f957dbf-9215-41ea-a705-b24c010b2212[panopto, title="Exclude file extensions for a sync relationship"]
+
NOTE: Regex, or regular expressions, differ from wildcards or glob expressions. This feature *only* works with regex.

Exclude Directories:: Specify a maximum of 15 regex or directories to exclude from the sync by typing their name or directory full path and pressing *Enter*. The .copy-offload, .snapshot, ~snapshot directories are excluded by default.
+
NOTE: Regex, or regular expressions, differ from wildcards or glob expressions. This feature *only* works with regex.

File Size:: Choose to sync all files regardless of their size or just files that are in a specific size range.

Date Modified:: Choose all files regardless of their last modified date, files modified after a specific date, before a specific date, or between a time range.

Date Created:: When an SMB server is the source, this setting enables you to sync files that were created after a specific date, before a specific date, or between a specific time range.

ACL - Access Control List:: Copy ACLs only, files only, or ACLs and files from an SMB server by enabling a setting when you create a relationship or after you create a relationship.

. Select *Save Settings*.

.Result

Copy and Sync modifies the sync relationship with the new settings.

== Delete relationships

You can delete a sync relationship, if you no longer need to sync data between the source and target. This action doesn't delete the data broker group (or the individual data broker instances) and it does not delete data from the target.

=== Option 1: Delete a single sync relationship

.Steps

. From the *Dashboard*, navigate to the sync relationship and select image:icon-sync-action.png[A screenshot of the button that enables you to take actions on a sync relationship]

. Select *Delete* and then select *Delete* again to confirm.

.Result

Copy and Sync deletes the sync relationship.

=== Option 2: Delete multiple sync relationships

.Steps

. From the *Dashboard*, navigate to the "Create New Sync" button and select image:icon-sync-action.png[A screenshot of the button that enables you to take actions on a sync relationship]

. Select the sync relationships you want to delete, select *Delete* and then select *Delete* again to confirm.

.Result

Copy and Sync deletes the sync relationships.
