Create and view reports in NetApp Copy and Sync to get information that you can use with the help of NetApp personnel to tune a data broker's configuration and improve performance.

Each report provides in-depth details about a path in a sync relationship. It will include how many directories, files, and symbolic links there are, the distribution of file size, how deep and wide the directories are, modify time, and access time. This differs from sync statics, which are available from the dashboard after https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-copy-sync/task-creating-relationships.html[successfully creating and completing a sync].

== Create reports

Each time that you create a report, Copy and Sync scans the path and then compiles the details into a report.

.Steps

. link:task-login-copyandsync.html[Log in to Copy and Sync].
. Select *Sync > Reports*.
+
The paths (source or target) in each of your sync relationships display in a table.

. In the *Reports Actions* column, go to a specific path and select *Create*, or select the action menu and select *Create New*.

. When the report is ready, select the action menu and select *View*.
+
Here's a sample report for a file system path.

And here's a sample report for object storage.

== Download reports

You can download a report in PDF so that you can view it offline or share it.

.Steps

. link:task-login-copyandsync.html[Log in to Copy and Sync].
. Select *Sync > Reports*.

. In the *Reports Actions* column, select the action menu and select *View*.

. In the top right of the report, select the action menu and select *Download pdf*.

== View report errors

The Paths table identifies whether any errors are present in the most recent report. An error identifies an issue that Copy and Sync faced when scanning the path.

For example, a report might contain permission denied errors. This type of error can affect Copy and Sync's ability to scan the entire set of files and directories.

After you view the list of errors, you can then address the issues and run the report again.

.Steps

. link:task-login-copyandsync.html[Log in to Copy and Sync].
. Select *Sync > Reports*.

. In the *Errors* column, identify whether any errors are present in a report.

. If errors are present, select the arrow next to the number of errors.
+

. Use the information in the error to correct the issue.
+
After you resolve the issue, the error shouldn't appear the next time that you run the report.

== Delete reports

You might delete a report of it contained an error that you fixed, or if the report is related to a sync relationship that you removed.

.Steps

. Select *Sync > Reports*.

. In the *Reports Actions* column, select the action menu for a path and select *Delete last report* or *Delete all reports*.

. Confirm that you want to delete the report or reports.
