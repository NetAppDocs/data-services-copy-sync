Getting started with NetApp Copy and Sync includes a few steps.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Log in and set up the NetApp Console

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You should have gotten started with the NetApp Console, which includes logging in, setting up an account, and possibly deploying a Console agent and creating systems.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you want to create sync relationships for any of the following, then you first need to create or discover a system:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* Amazon FSx for ONTAP
* Azure NetApp Files
* Cloud Volumes ONTAP
* On-prem ONTAP clusters

[role="quick-margin-para"]
A Console agent is required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, on-prem ONTAP clusters, and Amazon FSx for ONTAP.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Verify that your source and target are supported and set up. The most important requirement is to verify connectivity between the data broker group and the source and target locations.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The NetApp data broker software syncs data from a source to a target (this is called a _sync relationship_). You can run the data broker in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or on your premises. A data broker group, which consists of one or more data brokers, needs an outbound internet connection over port 443 so it can communicate with NetApp Copy and Sync and contact a few other services and repositories. link:reference-networking.html#networking-endpoints[View the list of endpoints].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
NetApp Copy and Sync guides you through the installation process when you create a sync relationship, at which point you can deploy a data broker in the cloud or download an install script for your own Linux host.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
